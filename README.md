# Keylogger
A simple python script is presented to simulate a Keylogger with the ability to register keystrokes on your device

$$Aviso: I will not be responsible for any theft of data, this script is for educational purposes only "do not use it for any unethical means"$$

$$Requerimentos$$: You need to have the pynput library for keylogger to work

Steps:

1.Create a folder somewhere in the drive and download the keylogger.pyw there and execute it

2.It will run silently in the background and record the keystrokes of the system

3.A text file named key_logs will be created in the same folder containing the key logs
